As someone who has always loved reading, I stumbled upon one of the most popular online fiction website A03 as a young teen, and I am to this day still unsure about why I was reading stories made by 12 years old rather than some Shakespeare. So I've asked myself: even among all these A03 stories, did I at least pick them according to how well they seemed to be written ? 

I use a dataset with 276 395 original works scrapped on AO3 by a group of CPES students in 2024.
