As someone who has always loved reading, I stumbled upon one of the most popular online fiction website A03 as a young teen, and I am to this day still unsure about why I was reading stories made by 12 years old rather than some Shakespeare. So I've asked myself: even among all these A03 stories, did I at least pick them according to how well they seemed to be written ? 

I use a dataset with 276 395 original works scrapped on AO3 by a group of CPES students in 2024. 

I test the following predictions:

*P1 - Works with a more complex summary are more likely to be read than others.*

*P2 - Works with a more complex summary are more likely to have more likes than others.*

*P3 - Works written in the 5 most used languages of the website are more likely to have a complex summary than others* 

To be sure that my results are not mere correlations, I also test if:  

*P4 - Works with more likes are more likely to be read than others*

*P5- Works written in the 5 most used languages of the website are more likely to have more likes than others.* 

*P6 - Works written in the 5 most used languages of the website are more likely to be read than others.*
