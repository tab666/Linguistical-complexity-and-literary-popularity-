# Linguistic project - How does the linguistical complexity of the summary of a literary work on AO3 influence its popularity ?
To run the code and dataset files, please decompress the project.zip 

As someone who has always loved reading, I stumbled upon one of the most popular online fiction website A03 as a young teen, and I am to this day still unsure about why I was reading stories made by 12 years old rather than some Shakespeare. So I've asked myself: even among all these A03 stories, did I at least pick them according to how well they seemed to be written ? 

In a world where litterature has changed a lot, it seemed interesting to see if how well a literary work is written influences its popularity or if it is up to completely other factors. (Aas there is no clear way to measure how well a summary is written I talk about its linguistical complexity instead). 

I use a dataset with 276 395 original works scrapped on AO3 by a group of CPES students in 2024. 
Using this dataset, I will test the following predictions:

### P1 - Works with a more complex summary are more likely to be read than others. 

### P2 - Works with a more complex summary are more likely to have more likes than others. 

### P3 - Works written in the 5 most used languages of the website are more likely to have a complex summary than others. 

To be sure that my results would not be mere correlations, I will also test if:  

### P4 - Works with more likes are more likely to be read than others. 

### P5- Works written in the 5 most used languages of the website are more likely to have more likes than others. 

### P6 - Works written in the 5 most used languages of the website are more likely to be read than others.
